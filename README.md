# First-time-with-machine-learning
Purely out of curiosity, last year I took a course for computer-science-major students in my university, called Introduction to Machine Learning. Before that, I had almost zero experience in programming. It was too late to withdraw when the professor announced that everyone had to write at least 3 algorithms taught in class to pass the course. I admit having panicked before the submission deadline, but eventually it took me 4 exhausting days to finish the project while learning python from scratch. The final codes were pretty messy, but I was still proud that I completed the task.

The 3 algorithms I wrote are linear model, neural network, and Adaboost. No external machine learning packages were allowed. The codes were tested on two data sets:
* Image dataset: MNIST

* Text dataset: The Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2)

Test results are included in my course report.
